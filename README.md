# Movie database backend  
Created with Nodejs, Express, Mongodb.  
Users can register, login and have options to add, view, update and delete movies.  
Each user can have their own favorite movies list and a movie watchlist.  
Movies can be sorted by **name**, **year** and **created date**.  
## Instructions  
* Before running the server, create a **.env** file and set a value for TOKEN_SECRET.  
* If you're not running Mongodb locally, go to the **index.js** file and while connecting to database, replace the default URI with the URL of the **Mongodb Atlas** collection that you have created.
